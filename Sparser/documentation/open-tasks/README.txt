This area of the documentation is for matters that have not yet been settled where various alternatives are under consideration. It is divided into two subdirectories, that roughly correspond to simple tasks ('problems') and broader matters whose solution may involve extending the mechanisms ('designs').

Problems are thing that need to be fixed -- another instance of something we already know how to do. Designs are ways that they might be fixed.
