by moving "measure" out from under bio-method, a bunch of fallback
occurred 

the class "purposive-process" seems to have been defined (probably by
me, RJB) to be able to have a purpose modifier (e.g. "in order to
...". It is possible that this is really a case where the licensing is
from the AGENT of the process -- if the agent can be said to have a
purpose, then such a modifier is licensed, and more generally "John
did X in order to accomplish Y" can be replaced with "John
accomplished Y by doing X"
