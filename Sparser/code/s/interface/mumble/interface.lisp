;; File for Mumble methods specialized on Sparser classes

;; initiated 11/12/10. Elaborated through ..12/9 Picked up again 3/16/11.
;; Refactored to use realization-history for the crawling around 3/20.
;; 11/21/11 Added sanity check that we're annotating realizations. 10/12/12
;; added methods that start with edges. 
;; 0.1 (11/18/13) Removed all rnode/psi centric code  out to rnode-centric
;;      to clear the decks for working more directly with Krisp objects
;;      and improvising. 1/5/16 kill ad-hoc-1 to quiet compiler
