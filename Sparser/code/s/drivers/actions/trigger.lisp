;; initiated 6/90
;; 1.1 (10/21/91 v2.0) Completely revamped.  10/27 fixed typos. 10/30 ditto.
;;     (7/13 v2.2) shifted the trace to be ...-hook so it wouldn't clutter
;;       as much.
;; 2.0 (6/11/93 v2.3) Added position args to word version
;; 2.1 (11/12/93) fixed buggy arguments in category version and flushed
;;      polyword case
;; 2.2 (6/9/15) Put a polyword case back in (very different polywords now)
