;;;   Module:  "drivers;chart:psp:"    ;; in a segment
;;;  Version:  March 2019

;; 4.0 (5/7/93 v2.3) Bringing into sinc with the new word-level driver
;; 5.0 (3/15/94) Added dotted-rule hack
;; 5.1 (5/6/94) added new initiating call to get a good trace
;; 5.2 (1/10/15) record all NG chunks for analysis when *save-chunk-edges* is T
;; 5.3 (1/12/15) Option for specialized np parser.
;; 5.4 (1/14/2015 specialized chunk parser for NG and VG
;;  D1/19/2015 ebugged the new chunk parsing algorithm
;;  and made the selection of rules for NG and VG different,
;;  to account for how verb+ing modifies NG
;; 5.5 (2/11/15) After finding this algorithm copies in the chunker
;;  proper and making what runs here moot, removed the copy and
;;  rewrote this version to take the bast of that one and integrate
;;  a real 'choose the best' locus, presently a trivial default
;; 2/4/2015 cache rules discovered for pairs of edges so that we do not
;;   keep calling multiply-edges unnecessarily
;; 6/5/2-15 Use different parsers for NG, VG and ADJG -- NG is right to
;;   left, ADJG and VG are left to right this needs to be reviewed, but it
;;   helps with "will likely be useful" where the modal wants to be
;;   associated with the "be'
;; 6/28/2015 Don't call march-back-from-the-right/segment when segment has
;;   been fully parsed
