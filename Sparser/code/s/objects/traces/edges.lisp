;; initiated 8/90
;; 10/30/91 added *trace-paired-punctuation*. 6/18/92 added *trace-terminal-edges*
;; 1.0 (3/8/93 v2.3) tweeked definition of :multiply-succeeded to allow for
;;       multiple completions
;;       5/7 added cases for marching, 5/15 added case in check organizers.
;;       5/5/94 added functions for turning both sets on/off
;; 1.1 (5/12) added traces for brackets introduced from edges
;;     (9/28) tweeked traces for check
;;     (12/29) added more at the beginning of Multiply and its dispatch
;; 1.2 (12/30) cleaned up and added cases for syntax rules
;;     (2/9/05) Adding traces for multiplying referent categories. 4/1 added one
;;      for mulitiple completions.
;;     (8/21/07) Added cases for threading through multiply to debug its rebuild.
;;     (3/8/13) Added *trace-do-edge* which is used outside of the tr machinery in
;;      drivers/chart/psp/march-seg and presumably elsewhere. Moved out the forest
;;      traces to traces/treetops. 4/20/15 wrote trace-rules-source-and-validity
