;;;  version:  September 2020

;; initiated 9/28/94 v2.3.  Added Super-categories-of 3/3/95
;; Added Compute-daughter-relationships 6/21.  Added Super-category-has-variable-named
;; on 7/7.  11/29/97 moved to [lattice-points;].
;; 0.1 (3/22/98) started revamping the routines. Moved Lookup-fn-data-of-parent in
;;      from [individuals;index].
;;     (1/24/99) fixed Category-inherits-type? to conform to current model.
;;     (9/20) fixed infinite loop in Super-categories-of.
;; 0.2 (9/30) Modified Lookup-fn-data-of-parent to allow it to return nil if it
;;      tops out without finding any data rather than break.
;;     (2/9/05) Moved in some routines from 'composite referent'. 2/10 added
;;      all-categories-in-psi. (3/17) Added self-lattice-point to all-categories-
;;      in-psi. (2/22/07) added top-lattice-point to it.
;; 1.0 (7/23/09) fan-out from psi redesign. Working on it through 8/7
;;     (1/11/11) Fixed call to lattice field of operations when the category
;;      didn't have any because it was made by DM&P. Also patched inherited-
;;      operation/Reclaim to not complain if there was no parent with a
;;      reclaim operation. Whole scheme needs to be considered.
;;     (2/23/13) Put a trap in category-inherits-type? for the case of a
;;      category having itself as its super-type. Announces the problem and
;;      returns nil. (4/9/13) Extended super-categories-of, and again on 5/23/13.
;;     (5/26/13) added hack version of psi-inherits-type? that calls the individual's
;;      case since the all-categories code for psi doesn't look at the lattice
;; 1.1 (8/14/13) Made category-inherits-type? look at the base case of the
;;      category being identical to the supercategory. Same as super-categories of.
;; 1.2 (11/9/13) Added mixins check to the supercategory sweep. 
;;     (1/13/14) added it to category-inherits-type?
;;     (3/3/14) Fixed bug where mixins on super-categories were being misseed and
;;      started caching superc's on the category's plist.
;;     (5/22/14) Wrote display-category-tree and some ancilary routines to print
;;      the whole set of categories nicely. 
;;     (3/21/2015) SBCL caught application of lp-super-category to non lattice point --
;;       form categories are not in a lattice...
;;     (8/12/15) Removed references to PSI.
;;     (10/9/15 moved in useful functions from psi directory.
;;     (10/15/15) added predicate to look for a category having a single variable
;;       This is probably an expediency for something more deliberate, since the
;;       real question is, if we're to binds a dependent individual to a variable
;;       on the head individual, what variable should we use.
