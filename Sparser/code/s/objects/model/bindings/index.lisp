;; initiated 7/20/92 v2.3
;; (6/4/93) tweeked the checks for valid values in Index/binding
;; (1/7/94) added Binding-of-bindings. allowed bindings to be done to categories
;; 0.1 (4/29) refined Index/binding and left a stub. (8/8) added Bound-as
;;      Continued tweeking ...8/19
;; 0.2 (1/7/96) added Unindex/binding and subrs.
;;     (3/4/05) added optional to Index/binding to just index the value
;;     (4/1/13) Added checks for the variable being anonymous, which post-dates
;;      all this code. Ignored index link to the value
;; 0.3 3/21/2015 key changes to find/binding based on SBCL profiling
;;     3/21/2015 FIX OVERZEALOUS correction of find/binding -- some problem in lookup for
;;       find/binding which caused bad definition in (define-unit-of-measure ...) for "nm"
;;     3/22/2015 speed up access to var-instances by using hash table
;;     4/18/15 Continued redefinition of find/binding by searching on the
;;        individual rather than the list of bindings on the variable

#|  7/20/92
    Bindings are either permanent or temporary.  If temporary, they
 are stored in the binding-resource and are allocated and deallocated.
 If permanent, there is no such global pointer to all of them.

    Bindings are pointed to by the "binds" fields of the individuals
 in their body fields, and the "bound-in" fields of the individuals
 in their value fields.  They are also cross indexed as "instances"
 of their variables.
