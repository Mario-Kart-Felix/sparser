;; initiated 11/30 v2.1
;; 7/17/92 v2.3 revised the definition
;; 6/7/93 added Value-of covering Value/var to improve how it can be
;;  used from code. (1/10/94) Added All-bindings-such-that and Up-and-over.
;;  (4/1) added value-of/binding
;; 0.1 (6/13) redefined Value-of to return nil rather than break when there is
;;      no variable of that name
;;     (8/3) added All-values-for  (8/4) added Has-binding  
;; 0.2 (8/10) added a field for a permanent index.  8/17 added Add-item-to-list-value
;;      8/29 added Binds.  10/5 added Bound-in
;;      11/29 added 'all' keyword args. to those two functions
;; 0.3 (7/7/95) elaborated Value-of to take bindings off of referential categories
;;     (9/19) tweeked Value-of to pre-empt the var decoding routine from breaking
;;      on ambiguous variables
;; 0.4 (1/31/99) extended value-of to appreciate psi.
;;     (9/7) Debugged that extension to typecase when it disambiguates variables
;; 0.5 (9/27) Extended Bound-in to allow the body of the bindings it examines to
;;      be categories. Needed to handle the binding of an ordinal to a number, where
;;      the ordinal is here construed as a category rather than an individual.
;;     (8/5/00) Rewrote value/var to handle the typecase within value-of.
;;     (2/2/05) Fixed format dumb-o in bound-in
;; 2.0 (7/14/09) Fan-out from new way of indexing variables because they're now lexical
;; 2.1 (1/18/11) Changed value-of to have an optional category argument to overrule 
;;      the category inferred from the individual. If the variable doesn't exist
;;      when the category is specified then we signal an error. 2/13/13 added an
;;      argument test to value-of. 4.7.13 added with-bindings, and an escape for
;;      value-of
;; 2.2 (5/28/13) Added who-binds as analog of value-of for the bound-in field.
;;     (6/15/13) Clarified what has-binding is doing an added guards to ensure
;;      that it's used correctly.
;; 2.3 (8/26/13) Refactored value of bindings search a bit. Added bound-in-value-of
;;      as direct analog of value-of
;;     (10/27/14) added open-in method
;; 3/22/2015 speed up access to var-instances by using hash table
