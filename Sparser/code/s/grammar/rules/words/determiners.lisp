;; broken out from "fn words - cases" 12/17/92 v2.3
;; 0.1 (6/8) added Define-determiner
;; 0.2 (7/11) changed assignment on the, a, & an to .[article from .[np
;; 0.3 (11/16) gave them all form categories on their literal edges
;; 0.4 (12/5) flushed "additional" which had been included because of LS's judgement
;; 0.5 (1/30/95) gave 'that' its own '[' bracket
;; 0.6 (6/16/08) Adding a set of brackets for the single-capitalized-letter
;;      form of "a". (11/10/12) neither, either. 12/4/12 "those".
;; 0.7 (10/29/14) Makeover sort of following the pattern in conjunctions.

 model notions like distal vs. proxal.")
