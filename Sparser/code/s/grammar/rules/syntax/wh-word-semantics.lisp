;; initiated 8/8/07. Added relatives 1/1/08
;; 0.1 Changed the names of the categories to just be the name of the pronoun.
;;     Had been, e.g., WHERE-OBLIQUE-PRONOUN-PRONOUN. Changed the from from NP to
;;     wh-pronoun.
;; 0.2 (1/18/13) Complete make over on the style of prepositions
;;     (2/28/13) Changed the form of the rule to wh-pronoun
;; 4/24/2015 remove whether as a wh-pronoun, to allow adding whethercomp as a type of verb complement
