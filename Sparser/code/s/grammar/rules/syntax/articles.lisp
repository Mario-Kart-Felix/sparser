;; initiated 10/25/92 w/ mixin.  Given some content 5/17/95.  Added np cases
;; 4/1/05. Added common-noun 4/12/09. 10/14/12 Removed the 'that' rules 
;; because they preempt relative clause interpretation. 1/30/13 Added 
;; the+proper-name. 8/7/14 Added the other definite determiners, don't
;; remember what the problem might hae been. Added defNP dereference to
;; "these". 3/2/15 Converted 'this' cases to defNP.
;; 0.1 6/28/15 Pulled all the literal "the" form rules in favor of
;;  their equivalents that were make with define-determner.
;;  Need to do the same with the indefinites and the others.
;; February 2006: Commented out form rules in favor of a uniform
;;  syntactic rule. Made variants of the predicates for other type.
