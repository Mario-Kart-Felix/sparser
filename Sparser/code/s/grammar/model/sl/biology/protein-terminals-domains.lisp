#|The convention for writing peptide sequences is 
to put the N-terminus on the left and write 
the sequence from N- to C-terminus. When the 
protein is translated from messenger RNA, 
it is created from N-terminus to C-terminus.|#

; There are two terminals, N and C, and they only make
; sense in a technical article when they're tied to 
; a particular protein.
; Semantically these are 'regions' in that they talk about
; things happening in these places. "region" is defined in
; dossiers/location-kinds.lisp as a region-type


; "located in both N- and C-terminal regions of p100"
; "via the ASPP2 N-terminus"
; the amino terminus of Î²-catenin
