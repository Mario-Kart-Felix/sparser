#| The purpose of these mixins is to pre-package compositional
options for parsing and phrasal patterns and options for generation
into natural classes.

At the same time these provide the standard set of variables
for the specific verbs, drawing primarily from the ECI set as
implemented in core/kinds/roles.lisp. That should also encapsulate
the choice of role since in many cases all that has to be done
for categories of specific verbs is specify the verb. 

The set of 'families' that can appear in the etf field of
a simplified realization for a verb are (5/17)
  sv: s, v
  svo: s, v, o
  svol: s, v, o1, o2
  svo-passive: s, v, o
  svcomp: s, v, c
