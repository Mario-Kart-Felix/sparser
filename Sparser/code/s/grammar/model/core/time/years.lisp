;; initiated in February 1991
;; 0.1 (4/9 v1.8.2)  Added the years from 1959 to 1979
;; 0.2 (7/31 v1.8.6)  Gave years "month" fields to facilitate real indexing
;; 1.0 (12/15/92 v2.3) setting up for new semantics
;; 1.1 (9/18/93) actually doing it.   10/20/94 breaking out the cases.
;; 2.0 (7/9/00) Reworked as psi.
;; 2.1 (8/20/08) shifting from proper to common noun because proper noun introduces
;;      a leading ].proper-noun, which seems like overkill. Also rewriting the
;;      category to go to self instead of time.
;; 2.2 (7/25/13) Added csr and function for one case of contextually establishing
;;      that a number is a year. 5/26/14 Moved comma-year here from dates2
